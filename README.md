# RO-Heyes-Saberian-2019
This repo hosts the public version history of the replication opinion on Heyes and Saberian (2019).

If the participants in the debate, or anyone else, changes my mind about anything in the opion, I will release a new version here. The releases will preserve the history.

I tried to use arXiv for this purpose but its semi-automatic filters choked on a document whose title begins with "Opinion." arXiv doesn't host opinions!

The data and code archive for this opinion is (on the Harvard Dataverse)[https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EPDXVX].
